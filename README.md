# notepad++ vue.js-syntax-highlighting
To use these files import the Vue.js User Defined Language .xml file for syntax highlighting.  The keyword list for AutoCompletion is to be copied to the plugins\API directory, vue.xml.

I am learning here, so some of these are far from perfect, and I am sure will need correcting as I can do it.

And, I think I'm the first to create one of these for Vue.js (even if it is not the greatest.)  So can I say, "First"?
